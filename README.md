## Background

  

Every December my husband has a game that he plays with his friends. They all listen to [the same radio station](https://www.audacy.com/majic/listen#recently-played) and listen for Mariah Carey's perennial hit "All I Want For Christmas Is You". The first to send a message to the group text wins a point. At the end of the month, whoever has the most points wins.

  

Naturally this means my husband spends a lot of time in the house distracted listening to this radio station, but after 10 years in retail I cannot stomach Christmas music. This year I resolved to build a bot to watch for him to make December a little easier on both of us ðŸ˜‚
